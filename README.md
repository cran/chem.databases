# chem.databases

R data package with chemical data mostly from the US federal government [the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States (US) Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), or the United States (US) Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI)] and a collection of chemical data from Wikipedia pages contained in the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard v2.2.1.  

The following is the description of the data sets:  

1) tsca

&ldquo;The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was enacted by Congress in 1976 and amended in 2016, and provides EPA authority to regulate certain new and existing chemicals commercialized in the United States for non-exempt purpose. Section 8(b) of TSCA requires EPA to compile, keep current, and publish a list of each chemical substance that is commercialized in the US for a TSCA use. The original TSCA Inventory was published in 1979 and included chemicals existing in US commerce at the time TSCA was first enacted. New chemicals are added to the Inventory when a Notice of Commencement is received for chemicals reported to the EPA under TSCA Section 5 through the Pre-Manufacture Notification (PMN) process.&rdquo; [https://cdxapps.epa.gov/oms-substance-registry-services/substance-list-details/169]  

2) atsdr

&ldquo;The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) database contains information about chemical substances that are considered to be toxicological profile candidates. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA or Superfund), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) requires ATSDR and EPA to maintain a Priority List of Hazardous Substances. Each substance on the priority list is a candidate to become the subject of a toxicological profile prepared by ATSDR with the subsequent identification of priority data for that substance. The ATSDR database includes chemicals from that priority list.&rdquo; [https://cdxapps.epa.gov/oms-substance-registry-services/substance-list-details/105]  

3) ld50

&ldquo;Multi-Species Acute Toxicity Database Download Page  
Toxicity measurements for 80,081 unique compounds  
The file contains curated data for acute toxicity, primarily focusing on the endpoints: lethal dose fifty (LD50); lethal dose low (LDLo); and toxic dose low (TDLo). It contains 80,081 unique compounds with measurements against 59 endpoints: different combinations of species (mouse, rat, rabbit etc.), exposure route (oral, skin, intramuscular, etc.) and dose metric (LD50, LDLo, TDLo). There is overlap between these data and the public data that were used in the creation of the Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECSÂ®) database.&rdquo; [https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/download/acute-toxicity-db/]  

4) chem_wiki

&ldquo;CompTox Chemicals Dashboard v2.2.1  
Description: Wikipedia includes data for thousands of chemicals. ChemBoxes and DrugBoxes includes data such as CAS Registry Numbers, SMILES and InChIs. This list is an assembly from various Wikipedia pages and is a list under ongoing curation and expansion (last updated 07/26/2022.&rdquo; [https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/WIKIPEDIA]
